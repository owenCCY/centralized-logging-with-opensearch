# VPC Flow Logs
[VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) enable you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

You can create a log ingestion into Amazon OpenSearch Service either by using the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console or by deploying a standalone CloudFormation stack.

!!! important "Important"
    - Centralized Logging with OpenSearch supports VPCs who publish the flow log data to an Amazon S3 bucket or a CloudWatch log group. When publishing to S3, The S3 Bucket region must be the same as the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch solution region.
    - The Amazon OpenSearch Service index is rotated on a daily basis by default, and you can adjust the index in the Additional Settings.

## Create log ingestion (OpenSearch Engine)

### Using the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch Console
1. Sign in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch Console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Log Analytics Pipelines**, choose **Service Log**.
3. Choose the **Create a log ingestion** button.
4. In the **AWS Services** section, choose **VPC Flow Logs**.
5. Choose **Next**.
6. Under **Specify settings**, choose **Automatic** or **Manual** for **VPC Flow Log enabling**. The automatic mode will enable the VPC Flow Log and save the logs to a centralized S3 bucket if logging is not enabled yet.
    - For **Automatic mode**, choose the VPC from the dropdown list.
    - For **Manual mode**, enter the **VPC Name** and **VPC Flow Logs location**.
    - (Optional) If you are ingesting VPC Flow logs from another account, select a [linked account](../link-account/index.md) from the **Account** dropdown list first.
 7. Under **Log Source**, select **S3** or **CloudWatch** as the source.
 8. Choose **Next**.
 9. In the **Specify OpenSearch domain** section, select an imported domain for **Amazon OpenSearch domain**.
 10. Choose **Yes** for **Sample dashboard** if you want to ingest an associated built-in Amazon OpenSearch Service dashboard.
 11. You can change the **Index Prefix** of the target Amazon OpenSearch Service index if needed. The default prefix is your VPC name.
 12. In the **Log Lifecycle** section, enter the number of days to manage the Amazon OpenSearch Service index lifecycle. The Centralized Logging with OpenSearch will create the associated [Index State Management (ISM)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/im-plugin/ism/index/) policy automatically for this pipeline.
13. In the **Select log processor** section, please choose the log processor.
    - When selecting Lambda as log processor, you can configure the Lambda concurrency if needed.
    - (Optional) OSI as log processor is now supported in these [regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/amazon-opensearch-service-ingestion/). When OSI is selected, please type in the minimum and maximum number of OCU. See more information [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ingestion.html#ingestion-scaling).
14. Choose **Next**.
 14. Add tags if needed.
 15. Choose **Create**.

## Create log ingestion (Light Engine)

### Using the Console
1. Sign in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch Console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Log Analytics Pipelines**, choose **Service Log**.
3. Choose the **Create a log ingestion** button.
4. In the **AWS Services** section, choose **Amazon VPC Flow**.
5. Choose **Light Engine**, Choose **Next**.
6. Under **Specify settings**, choose **Automatic** or **Manual** for **VPC Flow logs enabling**. The automatic mode will detect the VPC Flow log location automatically.
    - For **Automatic mode**, choose the VPC Flow from the dropdown lists.
      * For Standard Log, the solution will automatically detect the log location  if logging is enabled.
    - For **Manual mode**, enter the **VPC Flow ID** and **VPC Flow Log location**.
    - (Optional) If you are ingesting VpcFlow logs from another account, select a [linked account](../link-account/index.md) from the **Account** dropdown list first.
7. Choose **Next**.
9. In the **Specify Light Engine Configuration** section, if you want to ingest associated templated Grafana dashboards, select **Yes** for the sample dashboard.
10. You can choose an existing Grafana, or if you need to import a new one, you can go to Grafana for configuration.
12. Select an S3 bucket to store partitioned logs and define a name for the log table. We have provided a predefined table name, but you can modify it according to your business needs.
13. The log processing frequency is set to **5** minutes by default, with a minimum processing frequency of **1** minute.
14. In the **Log Lifecycle** section, enter the log merge time and log archive time. We have provided default values, but you can adjust them based on your business requirements.
15. Select **Next**.
16. If desired, add tags.
17. Select **Create**.

### Using the CloudFormation Stack
This automated AWS CloudFormation template deploys the *Centralized Logging with OpenSearch - VpcFlow Standard Log Ingestion* template in the AWS Cloud.

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and select the button to launch the AWS CloudFormation template. You can also download the template as a starting point for your own implementation.

2. To launch the stack in a different AWS Region, use the Region selector in the console navigation bar.

3. On the **Create stack** page, verify that the correct template URL shows in the **Amazon S3 URL** text box and choose **Next**.

4. On the **Specify stack details** page, assign a name to your solution stack.

5. Under **Parameters**, review the parameters for the template and modify them as necessary. This solution uses the following parameters.
