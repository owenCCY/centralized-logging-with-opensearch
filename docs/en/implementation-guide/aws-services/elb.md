# Application Load Balancing (ALB) Logs

[ALB Access logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html) provide access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer. ALB publishes a log file for each load
balancer node every 5 minutes.

You can create a log ingestion into Amazon OpenSearch Service or Light Engine either by using the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console or by deploying a standalone CloudFormation stack.

!!! important "Important"

    - The ELB logging bucket's region must be the same as the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch solution.
    - The Amazon OpenSearch Service index is rotated on a daily basis by default, and you can adjust the index in the Additional Settings.

## Create log ingestion (OpenSearch Engine)

### Using the Console

1. Sign in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch Console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Log Analytics Pipelines**, choose **Service Log**.
3. Choose the **Create a log ingestion** button.
4. In the **AWS Services** section, choose **Elastic Load Balancer**.
5. Choose **Amazon OpenSearch**, Choose **Next**.
6. Under **Specify settings**, choose **Automatic** or **Manual**.
    - For **Automatic** mode, choose an application load balancer in the dropdown list. (If the selected ALB access log is not enabled, click **Enable** to enable the ALB access log.)
    - For **Manual** mode, enter the **Application Load Balancer identifier** and **Log location**.
    - (Optional) If you are ingesting logs from another account, select a [linked account](../link-account/index.md) from the **Account** dropdown first.
7. Choose **Next**.
8. In the **Specify OpenSearch domain** section, select an imported domain for **Amazon OpenSearch domain**.
9. Choose **Yes** for **Sample dashboard** if you want to ingest an associated templated Amazon OpenSearch Service dashboard.
10. You can change the **Index Prefix** of the target Amazon OpenSearch Service index if needed. The default prefix is the `Load Balancer Name`.
11. In the **Log Lifecycle** section, input the number of days to manage the Amazon OpenSearch Service index lifecycle. The Centralized Logging with OpenSearch will create the associated [Index State Management (ISM)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/im-plugin/ism/index/) policy automatically for this pipeline.
13. In the **Select log processor** section, please choose the log processor.
    - When selecting Lambda as log processor, you can configure the Lambda concurrency if needed.
    - (Optional) OSI as log processor is now supported in these [regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/amazon-opensearch-service-ingestion/). When OSI is selected, please type in the minimum and maximum number of OCU. See more information [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ingestion.html#ingestion-scaling).
14. Choose **Next**.
13. Add tags if needed.
14. Choose **Create**.

### Using the CloudFormation Stack

#### Sample Dashboard

## Create log ingestion (Light Engine)

### Using the Console

1. Sign in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch Console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Log Analytics Pipelines**, choose **Service Log**.
3. Choose the **Create a log ingestion** button.
4. In the **AWS Services** section, choose **Elastic Load Balancer**.
5. Choose ** Light Engine**, Choose **Next**.
6. Under **Specify settings**, choose **Automatic** or **Manual**.
    - For **Automatic** mode, choose an application load balancer in the dropdown list. (If the selected ALB access log is not enabled, click **Enable** to enable the ALB access log.)
    - For **Manual** mode, enter the **Application Load Balancer identifier** and **Log location**.
    - (Optional) If you are ingesting logs from another account, select a [linked account](../link-account/index.md) from the **Account** dropdown first.
7. Choose **Next**.
8. **Log Processing** **Enriched fields**，The available plugins to choose from are **location** and **OS/User Agent**. Enabling rich fields will increase data processing latency and processing costs, it is not selected by default.
9. In the **Specify Light Engine Configuration** section, if you want to ingest associated templated Grafana dashboards, select **Yes** for the sample dashboard.
10. You can choose an existing Grafana, or if you need to import a new one, you can go to Grafana for configuration.
12. Select an S3 bucket to store partitioned logs and define a name for the log table. We have provided a predefined table name, but you can modify it according to your business needs.
13. The log processing frequency is set to **5** minutes by default, with a minimum processing frequency of **1** minute.
14. In the **Log Lifecycle** section, enter the log merge time and log archive time. We have provided default values, but you can adjust them based on your business requirements.
15. Select **Next**.
16. If desired, add tags.
17. Select **Create**.

### Using the CloudFormation Stack
This automated AWS CloudFormation template deploys the *Centralized Logging with OpenSearch - ELB Log Ingestion* solution in the AWS Cloud.
